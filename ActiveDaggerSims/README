General Vanadium Detector Readme

Date: Last code written on 6/3/2013

Introduction:
This file contains the location of the various parts of the simulation.

Included code:
	-Geant4 simulation:
		-VDetector.cc in the main directory
		-/src has .cc code (actual logic)
		-/include has .hh code (headers that define classes)
		-/build_dir has a README with information for compilation
	-Data analysis:
		-In build_dir/Datafiles/Data

Each of the included programs have their own README file and the code should
be all commented for better understanding.

I have been keeping macros to control the experiments in a seperate directory
from the output of the experiments. The logical setup of the directories is by
no means set in stone, it can be adjusted if need be. If a large simulation is
run, a lot of space could be taken up. A run of 1000 events where ~600 were
kept was 20 mb. The majority of the size is the list of photon hits and times
in the root file, which are not stored as floats to keep down on filesize.
